Problem Description:
Water is an important and essential component of human life as well as all plant and living species. Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions. 
Therefore there is a need for classification of potability of available water and hence decisions can be taken by authorities for treating before supplying to communities.

The quality of water to be determined for potability is dependent on the following physical, chemical and electrical parameters.

1.	pH Value
2.	Hardness
3.	Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
4.	Chloramines
5.	Sulfates
6.	Electrical Coductivity
7.	Organic Carbon
8.	Trihalomethanes
9.	Turbidit

Problem Statement:

Develop a Classification Model under supervised machine learning to Classify water as Potable (1) or Not Potable (0) based on the range of values supplied.
